Keep all trials
Remove neurons with coef covariation larger than 1. 
Remove neurons with hVis signed smaller than 0.2, which means 
in any condition, smaller than 20
Remove neurons with FR during task smaller than 1 spk/sec

Subsample with size control: use the minimum or the second minimum neuron number for each animal
